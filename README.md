# 🌊 Project MARS – Maritime Activity Recognition System

Automatically detect, track, and analyze maritime vessels from satellite videos using YOLOv8 + ByteTrack.

---

## 🧠 About

**Project MARS** is an AI-powered maritime monitoring system that processes satellite video feeds to:

- Detect vessels using YOLOv8
- Track them across frames with ByteTrack
- Output an annotated video
- Generate CSV logs of detections

Built with:

- Flask backend
- Clean HTML/CSS/JS frontend
- Deep learning + computer vision

## ✨ Features

| Feature                   | Description                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 📅 Video Upload           | Upload any `.mp4` satellite video via the web interface                |
| 🛰️ Vessel Detection      | YOLOv8 detects maritime vessels per frame                              |
| 🎯 ByteTrack Tracking     | Assigns unique IDs to vessels over time                                |
| 🎥 Annotated Output Video | Bounding boxes + track IDs overlaid in output `.mp4`                   |
| 📃 CSV Export             | Frame-by-frame detection logs as `vessel_tracks.csv`                   |
| ⚡ Fallback Logic          | Falls back to YOLOv8 COCO model if custom weights don’t detect vessels |
