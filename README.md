# Project-MARS
Project MARS identifies "dark vessels" by analyzing satellite imagery. Using a YOLOv8-OBB model, it detects a ship's precise heading and flags any vessel missing from AIS tracking data. A Kalman filter then predicts the vessel's path, transforming raw data into actionable intelligence to combat illicit maritime activity.
